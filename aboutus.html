            The clinic has been treating Irish patients since 2004. Because of the large number of Irish patients that have received 
            treatment, it was decided 7 years ago to open a surgery in Wexford for aftercare. A team travels from Hungary for 4 days 
            every month. The clinic also have a surgery in Ravenna, Italy.

            </br>
            </br>
            In the Postoperative surgery in Wexford the Dental Team treat patients before and after treatment in Hungary. 
            Prospective patients can visit Wexford for a consultation in one of the two surgeries. The clinic recently installed a 
            modern Digital Panoramic x - ray machine in Wexford. It is linked to the clinic in Hungary. The Dentist in Wexford will 
            have access to all the patients' x - rays and treatment records.
