                The growing number of European patients brought the idea to open our new dental clinics in Wexford and Ravenna.
                 Our dental specialists travel regularly to these cities to offer aftercare to patients who have been treated by 
                 us in Hungary. With this international presence it's a target to get closer to our European patients. In the new 
                 postoperative care and consultation clinic in Wexford we can look after your every needs, both before and after 
                 treatment in Hungary. The clinic has two fully equipped surgeries. Recently one of the most modern digital X-ray 
                 machines was installed which can give us very accurate pictures within minutes. Our computer system is linked 
                 to our clinic in Hungary, this way we have access to all the treatment records and former X-rays, wherever
