                Dental implantology is a special field of dentistry that uses dental prosthesis as a method to replace 
                tooth gaps. The aim is always the successful dental rehabilitation of the patients. During the implantation 
                inorganic materials are implanted into the tissues of the jawbone. The implanted teeth in their own or as a 
                fixed basement can substitute the patient's single or multiple tooth gaps.</p>

            </br> </br>
            Permanent toothlessness, chewing with gum damages the subjacent bone-tissue with the constant pressing, thus 
            stimulates bone-absorption. Not even dental plates hinder this harmful process. The time between losing teeth 
            and the implantation, is a very important factor for patients having tooth-gap, because the available bone 
            structure determines its success. Toothlessness renders nutrition, we cannot chew well, and damages the whole 
            organism. Adverse alterations, declining processes arise in jawbones and joints: the height of jawbones decreases 
            the face collapses, the wrinkles deepen.Teeth look for the contact with their chewing-pairs and the neighbouring 
            teeth. So if for example our lower sixth tooth is missing, the sixth above it slowly but surely rises from the 
            tooth-bed, and in long term we may loose another teeth.Since misfortune never come alone, the seventh tooth 
            behind the missing sixth topples forward. It is obvious, how important it is to insist on our teeth, but if it 
            has to be extracted, replace it as soon as possible.The implant is made of titanium, which has an advantageous 
            feature, it prevents bone-decline. </p>

            </br> </br>
            The implanting doctor first of all inquires about the patient's general state of health and his claims. An exact 
            plaster impression and a panorama X-ray photograph are taken of the planned place. The required oral hygiene, 
            the good state of health and the appropriate jawbone structure, where the implant has to be planted are essential 
            for implanting teeth.With the help of these the anatomical conditions can be appreciated, with the consideration 
            of the available bone structure and patterns the best shape and size for the implant can be chosen. </p>

                    also informed about the possibilities, how many implants he can wear, what he has to do before and after 
                    the operation. The final plan is drawn up together with the patient.By following the doctor's directions

                        A week after the operation the stitches are taken out, the implants can recover tranquilly in the bone, 
                        under the protection of the mucous membrane. The wound closed during the operation provides sterile 
                        environment to the untroubled recovery of the bone tissue around the implant, under the gum. 
                        The recovery of the bone generally lasts three months in the lower jawbone, and six months in the 
                        upper. After that, in the second phase, the implant is released from the mucous membrane and a 
                        recovery-screw is put into it, which is later going to be the carrier of the implant-head in the buccal 
                        cavity. It is possible to wear a temporary implant during the recovery if desired.

                    Materials used for implanting have to meet very strict requirements. They have to be compatible with 
                    living tissues, must not have poisonous, allergic or malignant effects and must not corrode. They have 
                    to have the required flexibility, tensile strength, capacity and abrassion-proofness. They have to be 
                    well sterilizable and easy to work with. A part of the available materials is made of metal or alloy, 
                    such as titanium.Due to its external oxide layer it is quite stable and it has a high external energy, 
                    so it is able to join with different molecules and proteins, with which the protein-structures of the 
                    bone tissue later can join. That is how osseous fixing of the implant happens. Besides the ones mentioned

                    Implantation is a surgical intervention. In case of anxiety it can be eased with sedative-relaxing 
                    medicines and can be painless with the use of anaesthesia. Implanting one or two implants has the same 
                    encumbrance as tooth extraction. In case of implanting more implants at the same time or if the patient 
                    is strongly anxious, there are other possibilities. Treating and easing the anxious patients' 
                    unpleasantness becomes more and more important.
                </br> </br>
                    According to a survey carried out by the Institution of German Dentists, 75 per cent of the interviewed 
                    admitted that they have little or medium fear preceding dental treatments. 15 per cent admitted great fear. 
                    The interviewed also admitted that besides the well-known syndromes (shivering, intense heartbeat, 
                    perspiration waves), they are afraid of getting into panic, having great pains; loosing self-control, 
                    nauseating or possibly fainting, especially at the dentist.
                </br> </br>
                    Many people feel ashamed of their bad teeth so much that their self-confidence, which is already small 
                    because of the awkward situation, even more decreases. Thus laughing or socialising is impossible for them. 
                    It is very hard if not impossible for the patient to get out of this vicious circle alone. It is even 
                    harder, since it is still a taboo in public. We try to help you. The first treatment happens after giving 
                    special advice.

                    Inserting the implanted tooth substitute in the mouth does not put an end to the relation between patient 
                    and doctor.
                    One of the most important conditions of the success of implanted tooth substitution is to keep the mouth 
                    clean, the adequate oral hygiene and the regular dental checking. The patient has to come to a 
                    control-examination usually once a year. Them we make sure that the implant fits to its new place.

                </br> </br>
                It is a revival of an old method, since dinitrogen-oxide is used for sedation in various fields of medical 
                science for the 19th century. The situation is the same with dentistry. It is recommended mainly to anxious 
                patients, since besides being an analgesic, dinitrogen-oxide dissolves fear. In the US and in many other 
                countries, such as Britain, Australia and the Scandinavian countries more than 50 per cent of the dentists 
                use dinitrogen-oxide during treatments.
            </br> </br>
            <i>How does dinitrogen-oxide work?</i></br>
            Even a small amount of dinitrogen-oxide breathed in through a small nose-mask has a considerable effect. The sense 
            of relief and the decreasing of anxiousness create an easy state of trance, during which the patient is conscious 
            and is able to communicate with his doctor and answers questions, gargle, etc. His swallow-reflex remains, so he 
            can not swallow aside. He should not be afraid of such delusions; side effects will not appear. The sense of 
            safeness replaces fear and anxiety, which may be increased with a relaxing music through earphones. This state 
            is called pleasure-hypnosis. Together with fear, pain is also gone, thus the analgesic injection can not cause any 
            trouble to the patient. At the first time we apply the smallest possible quantity of medicine, which surely has a 
            sedative effect. Then we gradually increase the dose till reaching complete painlessness. Dosing depends on the 
            patient's ability of suffering pain; if he feels pain during the treatment, he can get anaesthetic injection any 
            time he asks for it, since the doctor is able to control the mixture of oxygen and dinitrogen-oxide at any time. 
            After the treatment the patient breath in pure oxygen for five more minutes, till the effect of dinitrogen-oxide is 
            gone. Thus the patient can leave the surgery safely, after the treatment.
        </br> </br>
        <i>Medicinal pre-treatment</i></br>
        Preparing patients with medicines means psychical calming and fear-dissolving. With the help of these, the undesirable 
        subconscious negative feelings can be decreased before treatments.
        </br> </br>
        <i>When do we apply it?</i></br>
        We apply it in such cases when we have to deal with an anxious patient, especially if strong retching and nausea are 
        expected. It is also used in case of such patients, who have already had or are susceptible to different diseases 
        (heart and circulatory-troubles), or if their limited co-operative ability requires it.

                <p class="hosszu-p-text" id="nem-bold"><b>Local anaesthesia</b>
                </br> </br>
                Local anaesthesia allows us to execute examinations and treatments without pain, while the patient is 
                absolutely conscious. Local anaesthesia hinders the expansion of pain stimuli; it palliates and dissolves 
                sensitivity to pain, temperature and touch, for a certain time.
            </br> </br>
            <i>Field of applying:</i></br>
            It is applied in case of small and medium interventions of the mouth, teeth, jaw and face, acute, chronic pain 
            and painful, diagnostic interventions.

                </br> </br>
                With the injection of analgesics, sedative medicines through the vein, we are able to cut off the patient's 
                pain-centre, thus we create a calm and sleepy state. Then we can avoid the creation of fears, but we can protect the 
                heart, the encumbrance and the lungs from physical stress, which may be caused by angst and anxiety. The patient is 
                absolutely conscious and breathes alone during the treatment. In order to reach total painlessness, we apply local 
                anaesthetic.
            </br> </br>
            <i>When do we apply it?</i></br>
            We apply it in such cases, when the patient is extremely timid, anxious or his previous diseases (heart and circulatory troubles) 
            would be physically stress.
